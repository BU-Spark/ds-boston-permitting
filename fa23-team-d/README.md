# Boston Permitting Analysis - Team D

## Introduction
This report presents an in-depth analysis of the Boston permitting process. It assesses the economic impact, compliance with regulations, and socio-political factors influencing urban development.

## Datasets and Cleaning
Data from the City of Boston and the State of Massachusetts were cleaned to provide a foundation for accurate analysis. This included reconciling discrepancies and standardizing formats across building permits, zoning appeals, and demographic data.

## Methodology
Our methodology integrated in-depth analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning, employing a decision tree algorithm to derive insights from permit data, and spatial analysis to evaluate development patterns.

## Key Analyses
- **Trend Analysis**: Trends in permit approvals and valuations over time, which also revealed a dip in 2020 linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.
- **Geographic Distribution**: Analysis of permits by urban areas, indicating a concentration of activity in certain neighborhoods.
- **Economic and Demographic Disparities**: Utilizing Lorenz curves and Gini coefficients to highlight disparities in development distribution, with lower-income areas experiencing more permit rejections.

## Decision Tree Model Insights
Detailed insights from the decision tree model, explaining the influence of specific features on the likelihood of permit approval.

## COVID-19 Pandemic Analysis
Correlation analysis between pandemic data and permitting trends, showing how public health crises can significantly disrupt urban development.

## Conclusion
A synthesis of our findings, emphasizing the need for policy considerations to address the observed disparities and enhance urban planning.
