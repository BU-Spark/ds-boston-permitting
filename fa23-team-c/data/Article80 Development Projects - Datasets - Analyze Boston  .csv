- A modest increase in the maximum height of Buildings 3 and 4 due primarily to the need for more expansive rooftop mechanicals and an increased floor-to-floor height necessary to accommodate office/R&D/lab and life sciences uses;
- A significant reduction of approximately 500 vehicle parking spaces on the Site;
- An increase of approximately 3,669 square feet (?SF?) of additional civic open space accessible to the public than was proposed in the previously approved project; and

After an initial comment period Boston Properties has responded to feedback and filed a Draft Project Impact Report (DPIR) in January of 2017. The proposed project is conceived as a transformative, mixed-use, transit-oriented redevelopment, which will revitalize an underutilized urban site and transform the adjacent public realm, and integrate and connect the surrounding Back Bay, South End, and Bay Village historic neighborhoods. The proposed project is comprised of up to approximately 1.26 million square feet of mixed-use redevelopment, consisting of a new office building with ground floor retail, two new residential buildings, a one- to two-story vertical retail expansion of the existing Back Bay Station building, and the partial redevelopment of the existing 165 Dartmouth Street Garage.

All buildings are 5-story structures resting upon a one-story podium containing resident parking, bicycle storage and building services. Due to the native topography, the podium is well below the elevation of Sprague Street, which rises over the railroad grade adjacent to the project; as a result, the Sprague Building at the project?s primary pedestrian entrance appears as a 3-story building at the entry level. The buildings surround and create an extensively landscaped courtyard atop the podium. The courtyard provides access between amenities, orients building entrances and promotes community among residents. The courtyard features resident gathering spaces with outdoor recreation space, seating areas, BBQ grills and a variety of landscape and hardscape, as well as private patios. Pedestrian access from the courtyard up to Sprague Street is via a ?grand staircase? oriented toward the Readville commuter rail station to the north. A focal point of the courtyard is a two-story pavilion intended to house and promote work-share activities for the residents. Fronting the pavilion is a ?Town Square? plaza space with amenity spaces surrounding it including a large fitness facility, coffee shop, sports lounge, daycare and the work-share space. All buildings have direct courtyard entries, in addition to the Sprague Building?s entries to the outside neighborhood.
 
The vehicular entrance and drop-off are, as well as deliveries to the site, are below the podium and are accessed from Horne Street to the south.  
 
The Sprague Building, located along Sprague Street, contains 100 apartments with amenities that include fitness and gym space; a half-court for basketball, exercise studios and the project leasing office. Direct access from the vehicle drop off area up to the courtyard is provided through a staircase located beneath the Sprague Building.
 
The Courtyard Buildings, located along the rail yards to the east, contain 147 apartments and amenities that include the coffee shop, sports bar and day care facilities. The once- independent buildings are now linked into a single structure by a ?connector? allowing for the sharing of services and amenities. The link is recessed on both the west and east facades to allow the buildings to retain their independent identities when viewed from either direction, while providing an acoustic buffer from the active railway. A landscaped area, containing a dog run and fire lane, is located between the Courtyard Buildings and the rail lines.
 
Buildings are clad in masonry veneer, fiber cement panels and metal panels.  The buildings are designed with roof top solar panels to power the common spaces of the project. 

The unit mix consists of approximately 44 studios and urban flats (small studios); 107 1-bedrooms, 88 2-bedrooms, and 8 3-bedrooms.",http://www.bostonplans.org/projects/development-projects/36-40-sprague-street,42.2351,-71.1366,277043,0,

There were changes made to the proposed projects Phase I total unit count where the number of residential units has been increased from 51-55, the number of parking spaces were decreased from 74 to 72, and the number of building stories were decreased from 5 to 4-stories.

At DND?s instruction to reduce the size of several of the projects apartment units, as a result the project was left with residual space within the footprint of residential floor.  So, rather than change the building footprint, the proponent decided to add four additional units to absorb the excess space.

Phase I will include the construction of a four-story building consisting of 55 units of housing, 7,284 square feet of commercial office space, and 74 parking spaces in a two-level garage located on the Warren and Clifford Streets portion of the project.

The reporters, journalists, and TV personalities who work at the studio have benefited as well from the accessible location in the City for reporting.

The Columbia Crossing project will complement and support the Upham?s Corner ?Arts and Innovation District.? The project is particularly suited for artists, and 20% of the units are specifically designated for artists. The new building retains and embraces the iconic Dorchester Savings Bank as a prominent design feature including retaining its distinctive banking hall. An added transparent element referred to as the ?Glow Box? contributes additional publicly accessible open space as a neighborhood amenity. The bank hall and ""glow box"" will provide approximately 3,500 square feet of civic, arts, and commercial space that will help to anchor Upham?s Corner as an arts and cultural district. A prominent gallery space to be known as ?the Glow Box?, will feature high ceilings, glass walls, and flexible interior space, and will front along Columbia Road. This serves as the public face of the building, and will be available for public and community uses. Ample storage space is provided for artists living in the building who need more space than what is provided within their residential units. Together, these spaces will provide a complement to the Strand Theatre as the district?s anchor arts institution, adding variety to the performance and art display space available within the neighborhood.",http://www.bostonplans.org/projects/development-projects/columbia-crossing,42.3168,-71.0659,66000,0,
