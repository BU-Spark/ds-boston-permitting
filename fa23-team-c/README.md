**City of Boston: Permitting**
Team C

Boston's urban landscape is molded by the myriad of building permits granted each year. Yet, essential questions linger: What types of permits, characterized by worktype, valuation, and occupancy, dominate the approvals? How have these trends evolved over the past five years? Beyond the numbers, who are the key players seeking these permits, and what geographical patterns emerge from both the permit requests and the decisions of the zoning board of appeal? As we venture into this analysis, we also strive to uncover the deeper socio-economic layers, probing into the racial, ethnic, and income profiles of neighborhoods where these permits originate.

The overall goal of this project is to provide the city of Boston with a better understanding of the data around approvals and denials for permits to build or conduct renovations in order to ensure that residents and businesses are receiving equitable treatment, as well as analyzing its effects on housing cost.

The data that we collected is stored in CSV files, containing information about building permits, construction projects, and zoning appeals in a table format. Each project, permit, or appeal has a table id, unique identifier assigned, along with key information such as the address and description about the project, permit, or appeal.

To navigate through this repo:
* In the data folder, we have provided all the data used in our project already preprocessed into clean CSVs. Download this entire folder to be able to run our code. 
* In the Code folder, we have separated all the data analysis by dataset. Each dataset has its respective Jupyter Notebook in which we performed all EDA and created all of our graphs. Extension project work is all within the voting.ipynb file.
